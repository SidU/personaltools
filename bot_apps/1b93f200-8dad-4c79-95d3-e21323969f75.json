  "longDescription": "High performing, highly engaged, and long-serving. These are the characteristics of teams that openly and authentically celebrate good work. But how do make a habit of it? How do you absorb it into your culture?\n\n**Good news.** You already have the key ingredients:\n* A team that does good work.\n* People who see and value the good work being done around them.\n\nBy making it easy, social, and rewarding to articulate that appreciation, Zuzo turns your ingredients into the fuel for a self-propelled employee recognition machine that's built right into your Microsoft Teams experience.\n**How It Works:**\n* ü™ô **Rewards Credits:** Every team member begins the month with 100 credits. These can be given out to colleagues through written messages of appreciation. Credits are topped up each month.\n* üì¢ **Recognition Channel:** Choose a Teams channel to be your designated venue for public exchanges of recognition. People will be able to post into the channel and celebrate one another's contributions.\n* üéâ **Nominate & Endorse:** Appreciating some good work? Capture the moment in a Zuzo nomination and post it into your recognition channel. Others on the team can then respond to and endorse your nomination to pile on the praise.\n* üéÅ **Meaningful Rewards:** All nominations and endorsements carry a corresponding credit reward that is selected by the giver. These are instantly transferred onto the recipients' Zuzo app for them to treat themselves to meaningful rewards.\n* üíö **Drive Values:** Every nomination is an opportunity to reinforce your team's values by giving users the option of tagging a value in their submission.\n\n**Then What?**\nThe power of true peer-driven recognition begins to play out. Quiet performers start to get noticed. Stand-out moments receive generous praise and additional top-ups to their Zuzo Card. Employees spend their balances on meaningful rewards. People begin to look out for and reinforce their colleagues' good work. Culture shift.\n\n**Getting Started**\nIn order to use this app you must have an active Zuzo account. Please visit [www.zuzocard.com](https://www.zuzocard.com) to get started, or contact us for more details at [hello@zuzocard.com](mailto:hello@zuzocard.com).\n\n**Have Questions or Feedback?**\nEmail us at [support@zuzocard.com](mailto:support@zuzocard.com) or connect with us via our [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zuzocard).\nYou can also peruse our FAQs at [www.zuzocard.com](https://www.zuzocard.com).\n\nSupported clients: Microsoft Teams, Outlook and Microsoft 365. Currently only available in South Africa. More regions coming soon.",
