  "longDescription": "Manager360 for Microsoft Teams gives managers a consistent system for managing, leading, and coaching their team to success.\n\nWith Manager360, you have a playbook for covering your bases as an exceptional manager. All major facets of the proven Manager360 Leadership System are integrated into the app—along with AI-enabled coaching on the pivotal management and leadership topics.\n\nDASHBOARD OVERVIEW OF YOUR WHOLE TEAM\n\nSee your teams prioritized goals, upcoming tasks, calendar, and individual health scores in one view. Make announcements to your team and be notified of recommended actions, such as scheduling a 1-on-1 or closing out goals at quarter-end.\n\nSTAY ON RHYTHM WITH YOUR MANAGERIAL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nManager360 prompts you to fulfill your key duties as head of your team, whether you’re on mobile or desktop:\n    - Schedule & hold weekly team meetings\n    - Schedule & hold weekly or biweekly 1-on-1s\n    - Record quarterly performance reviews\n    - Set, track & complete team/individual goals\n    - Share key announcements and celebrate success with your team\n\nLIGHT-TOUCH ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nManager360 allows you settle on clear expectations with your employees, and ensure execution without micromanaging. You are guided in the process of setting SMART goals with each employee for the quarter, and you then see predictive updates weekly from the employee—showing you where your attention is needed.\n\nYou can also assign, track, and complete tasks—great for ensuring that next steps you discuss with employees, in meetings or elsewhere, get done.\n\nPERSONALIZE YOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nExceptional managers know that every team member is different. Manager360 captures employee strengths and working styles for easy reference, so you can tailor how you give feedback, motivate, assign work, and more.\n\nYou and your team will also be prompted to write and share their own User Manuals within the app. User Manuals capture the unique quirks of an individual in the workplace, including how they work best, what their self-perceived strengths and weaknesses are, and things people commonly misperceive about them. When User Manuals are shared among a team, collaboration and cooperation get a huge boost.\n\nCONTINUALLY HONE YOUR MANAGEMENT, LEADERSHIP & COACHING SKILLS\n\nManager360 gives you regular training, in text and video, on the habits, practices, and tools of exceptional managers. Derived from our flagship Manager360 Leadership System course, the training is designed to give bosses practical, performance-boosting approaches they can apply right away.  Users must have an active Manager360 account, please contact our support team for more details.
