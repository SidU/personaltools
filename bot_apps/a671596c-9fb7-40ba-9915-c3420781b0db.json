  "longDescription": "Workbot EU is a bot platform by Workato that you can use to fully customize workflows, build ChatOps, and send custom, actionable notifications - without having to write a single line of code! In order to use this app, a Workato account is required. *Apps include*: Workday, Salesforce, Servicenow, Netsuite, Jira, Okta and 1000+ more! For more info, visit [Workbot for Microsoft Teams](https://www.workato.com/workbot-teams). *What Workbot EU can do*. Deal Desk: When a Deal desk request is created in Salesforce, the   request can also be sent to a specific channel or sent as a direct message. When clicking the Approve or Reject buttons, Workbot EU will authenticate the user to ensure that he/she has sufficient privileges to administer that action. IT Request Approvals: Quickly and easily request for equipment via ServiceNow from Microsoft Teams. The designated approver can also view the buyer history of the requester before approving or rejecting the request, and the requester will receive a message regarding the outcome. Order Fulfillment Approvals: When a purchase is made that needs to be fulfilled, like an eCommerce purchase, it often requires some form of approval. These can be routed to Microsoft Teams for a fast response. The fulfillment process can even be kickstarted automatically. Vacation / Expense Approvals: Going on a vacation or need to file for an expense report? Quickly request the approval from your manager within Microsoft Teams. All the information will be updated in your HR and Finance apps, like Workday and Expensify. Security Ops: Handle all your security operations from Microsoft Teams. You can connect Okta to Workbot EU to receive notifications for any suspicious activity like a login from an unusual location, and act on it right from Microsoft Teams. You can even perform actions such as viewing recent logins and provisioning/deprovisioning accounts. Automated ITOps Follow-up: Automatically assign a Jira or GitHub issue to someone when critical issues arise from a monitoring tool. Workbot EU can notify everyone in the appropriate channel when an issue is assigned or updated. Smart, Actionable Alerts from DevOps: Instead of receiving a firehose of alerts, you can define various thresholds, monitor velocity of alerts and then based on those settings, Workbot EU will post alerts to the relevant channel or user on Microsoft Teams. This app works only for EU region. To get started, install the bot and connect your apps. More at: [Workbot for Microsoft Teams](https://www.workato.com/workbot-teams)",
