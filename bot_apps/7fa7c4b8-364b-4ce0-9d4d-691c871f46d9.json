  "longDescription": "TrunkText for Microsoft Teams is an AI-powered tool designed to provide fast, accurate answers from your project documents. Tailored specifically for construction professionals, TrunkText automatically parses and structures data from your project's document set, allowing you and your team to ask direct questions and get instant, reliable answers backed by document sources. This streamlines decision-making and keeps teams informed without needing to dig through piles of paperwork.\nKey Features: AI-Driven Q&A: Simply type in your question about the project, and TrunkText will produce an answer along with supporting references from your project documents. Whether you're looking for details from RFIs, submittals, or current schedules, TrunkText retrieves precise answers to help reduce rework and prevent delays.\nSeamless Software Integration: TrunkText integrates directly with major construction software services, including Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud, P6, CMiC, Egnyte, and InEight. This ensures that all your project documents, from different platforms, are searchable and accessible within Microsoft Teams, providing a central hub for your projectâ€™s information.\nFocused Document Insights: TrunkText enables quick access to specific details you need for effective decision-making. It pulls the most relevant data from documents like RFIs, submittals, and other key reports, allowing your team to stay informed and act faster.\n\nAudience:\nTrunkText is perfect for Project Managers, Superintendents, and General Contractors seeking an efficient, AI-powered solution to manage and query project documentation. By having instant access to project details directly within Microsoft Teams, users can improve collaboration, streamline workflows, and reduce the time spent searching for critical information.\n\nLicensing Information:\nTo use TrunkText, a subscription is required. Additionally, licenses for the third-party software integrations (such as Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud, etc.) are necessary to make full use of the tool's capabilities. These integrations allow TrunkText to pull in project documents from various platforms, making them searchable and accessible directly within Teams.\n\nImportant Notes:\nThe responses generated by TrunkText are powered by artificial intelligence. While we strive to ensure the highest level of accuracy, these AI-generated responses are based on the data available in your project documents and should always be reviewed for accuracy. It's crucial to critically evaluate all AI-generated content and consult the original project documents when making significant project decisions.\n\nFor any questions, feedback, or to report inappropriate content generated by TrunkText, please contact our support team at support@trunk.tools.",
